# myedit

This is a proof of concept to see how hard it would be to write a code editor that

* Is native (WPF), no html/javascript: I really like the idea behind Brackets/Atom but here I want things blazing fast
* Embeded terminal to be able to run command within the editor
* Embeded file watcher that could trigger custom command line scripts
* Multi-rows of tabs, I love tabs, I open a lot of them, I don't like to scroll tabs !
